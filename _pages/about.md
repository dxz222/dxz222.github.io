I'm a first-year PhD at the [Department of Materials and Engineering](https://www.mse.cornell.edu/mse), Cornell University ([CU](https://www.cornell.edu/)). I worked on scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with [Prof. Wu Zhou](http://zhouwu.ucas.ac.cn/index/group/detail?id=8.html) from [STEM Group](http://zhouwu.ucas.ac.cn/) at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ([UCAS](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)) in my undergraduate. To pursue my goal, I also worked on universal materials discovery as a visiting student in [Prof. Gerbrand Ceder's group](https://ceder.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). Aligned with my goal of integrating scientific research with machine learning (ML), my interests lie in the fields (including but not limited to): 

(1) **ML-driven computational materials science:** accelerate materials discovery with machine learning tools, including ML interatomic potential and generative model.\\
(2) **ML-driven data analysis in electron microscopy:** develop machine learning techniques to improve spectral and imaging quality, track material defects, and enhance chemical characterization accuracy.\\
(3) **Data-centric scientific discovery from electron microscopy:** explore structural characteristics and relationship between structure and properties within complex materials, like amorphous, via data-centric methods.

During my junior year, I attended MIT as an exchange student where I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Rodrigo Freitas](https://dmse.mit.edu/people/rodrigo-freitas) on local crystal structure analysis in atomistic simulation.

I also lead a group of enthusiastic undergraduates dedicated to implementing advanced machine learning tools in the analysis of electron microscopic (EM) data. Our ultimate goal is to build a high-throughput and automatic digital analysis [EM platform](https://github.com/dxz222/DeepSTEM), eliminating possible barriers to SOTA methods for microscopists.

Plus, I initiated an [academic discussion community](../assets/Community_Wechat.png) at UCAS for students sharing common interests in integrating machine learning into science. Currently, the community members cover students from UCAS, Peking University, Tsinghua University, UIUC, NYU, etc.
