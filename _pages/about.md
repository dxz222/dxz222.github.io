I'm a fifth-year undergraduate at [School of Physical Sciences](https://physics.ucas.ac.cn/index.php/en/), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ([UCAS](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)), fortunately working with [Prof. Wu Zhou](http://zhouwu.ucas.ac.cn/index/group/detail?id=8.html) from [STEM Group@UCAS](http://zhouwu.ucas.ac.cn/). Aligned with my goal of integrating scientific research with machine learning (ML), my interests lie in the fields (including but not limited to): 

(1) **ML-driven computational condensed matter physics:** accelerate simulation and post-processing with machine learning tools, like ML interatomic potential and material discovery with generative model.\\
(2) **ML-driven data analysis in electron microscopy:** develop machine learning techniques to improve spectral and imaging quality, track material defects, and enhance chemical characterization ability.\\
(3) **Data-centric scientific discovery from electron microscopy:** explore structural characteristics and relationship between structure and properties within complex materials, like amorphous, via data-centric methods.

During my junior year, I attended MIT as an exchange student where I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Rodrigo Freitas](https://dmse.mit.edu/people/rodrigo-freitas).

I am now working as a visiting student in [Prof. Ceder's group](https://ceder.berkeley.edu/) on material simulation and discovery.

I also lead a group of enthusiastic undergraduates dedicated to implementing advanced machine learning tools in the analysis of electron microscopic (EM) data. Our ultimate goal is to build a **high-throughput** and **automatic** digital analysis [EM platform](../assets/DeepSTEM.png), **eliminating possible barriers to SOTA methods for microscopists**.

Plus, I initiated an **[academic discussion community](../assets/Community_Wechat.png)** at UCAS for students sharing common interests in integrating machine learning into science. Currently, the community covers members from UCAS, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and UIUC, etc.
