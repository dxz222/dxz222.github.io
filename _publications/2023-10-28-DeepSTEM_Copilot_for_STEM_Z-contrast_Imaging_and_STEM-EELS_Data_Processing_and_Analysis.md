DeepSTEM is an open-source AI copilot for STEM Z-Contrast imaging and STEM-EELS data processing and analysis.

•	High-precision chemical characterization with scanning transmission electron microscopy
•	Structural analysis and physical properties of amorphous monolayer carbon: r-VAE method
•	Isotope discrimination with atomic resolution: EELS denoising with machine learning
