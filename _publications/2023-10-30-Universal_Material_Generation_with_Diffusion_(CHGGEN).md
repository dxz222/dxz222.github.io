This paper is about crystal generation with a score-based diffusion model.

- Adapted a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based model and pre-trained CHGNet for 
more efficient crystal structure representation.
- Implemented a score-based diffusion model for stable material generation.
- Conducted property-guided material generation to create materials with specific desired 
properties.
